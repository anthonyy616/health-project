Project Overview: This is a final-year graduation project aimed at optimizing vital sign monitoring in hospitals and clinics. The system uses non-invasive, contactless methods where possible, combined with a wearable elastic band for continuous monitoring. 
Key vitals include: body temperature, 
blood pressure (estimated non-invasively), 
eye metrics (e.g., pupil dilation), 
heart rate (BPM), 
respiratory rate (breaths per minute), 
and age estimation via facial analysis.

Core Components:
	•	Contactless Station: Uses computer vision for temperature (infrared), heart rate (remote photoplethysmography - rPPG from facial color changes), respiratory rate (chest movement detection), pupil dilation (eye tracking), and age estimation (facial ML models).
	•	Wearable Elastic Band: Contains sensors for backup/continuous data (e.g., pulse oximeter for BPM, IMU for respiration). Custom chip (e.g., ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico) runs lightweight neural networks. Data sent via BLE to central unit.
	•	Central Unit: Raspberry Pi processes data, fuses inputs (e.g., Kalman filter), displays results on a dashboard, and alerts for anomalies.
Tech Stack:
	•	Software: Python 3.11, OpenCV (computer vision), MediaPipe (face/eye landmarks), PyTorch/TensorFlow (DL models, e.g., MobileNetV3 for age), TensorFlow Lite/ONNX for edge deployment, Flask/FastAPI (dashboard), MQTT/BLE for communication, SQLite/PostgreSQL (data storage).
	•	ML/DL: Supervised learning (not reinforcement). Transfer learning on pre-trained models. Datasets: UTKFace (age), UBFC-rPPG/VIPL-HR (heart rate), BreathData (respiration), FLIR/MAAS (thermal), custom thermal clips.
	•	Optimization: Mixed-precision training, data augmentation (flips, noise), early stopping, cosine annealing, quantization to int8. Target: 90-95% accuracy (e.g., age ±4 years, HR ±5 BPM).
	•	Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB) as hub, Logitech C920 webcam, MLX90614 IR sensor, MAX30102 pulse oximeter, MPU6050 IMU, ESP32-S3 dev kit, 3.7V 900mAh LiPo battery, elastic neoprene band.
Implementation Flow:
	1.	Data Collection: Use datasets + custom calibration (e.g., compare IR temp to clinical thermometer).
	2.	Model Training: Fine-tune on GPU/CPU, validate on unseen data.
	3.	Integration: Fuse sensor data on Pi, deploy quantized models to band.
	4.	Testing: On 20-30 volunteers, measure latency (<10s), battery life (>8 hours).
	5.	Scalability: Multi-Pi setup for wards; limitations: no arrhythmia detection, not medical-grade.
